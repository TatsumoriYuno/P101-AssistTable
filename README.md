# P101-GeneralAssistTable
A general mobility and quality-of-life tool for the video game [Pirate101].

Requires Cheat Engine to be installed in order to function.

Credit given to u/SmexnerMan for fixing the player coordinate values with each update.

## Important Notes

Noclip Controls: Hit the checkbox to toggle on/off, then use 5-0 to move on each axis(5/6 for X, 7/8 for Y, 9/0 for Z)

The cheat table's hotkeys, e. g. teleport-to-quest-arrow's [ ` ], will activate even when pirate101 is not tabbed.

Mission-specific teleports are activated by toggling their checkboxes.
